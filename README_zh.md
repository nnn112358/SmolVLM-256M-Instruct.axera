```

## 支持平台

- [x] AX650N
- [ ] AX630C

## 模型转换

[模型转换](./model_convert/README.md)

## 上板部署

- AX650N 的设备已预装 Ubuntu22.04
- 以 root 权限登陆 AX650N 的板卡设备
- 链接互联网，确保 AX650N 的设备能正常执行 `apt install`, `pip install` 等指令
- 已验证设备：AX650N DEMO Board、爱芯派Pro(AX650N)、爱芯派2(AX630C)

### Python API 运行

#### Requirements

将 npu_python_llm 拷贝到具备 python 环境的 AX650N 开发板或者 爱芯派Pro 上  
执行以下命令安装pyaxengine
```
cd {your path to npu_python_llm}/axengein 
pip install -e .
``` 

#### 添加环境变量

将以下两行添加到 `/root/.bashrc`(实际添加的路径需要自行检查)后，重新连接终端或者执行 `source ~/.bashrc`

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH={your path to npu_python_llm}/engine_so/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
``` 

#### 运行

在开发板上运行命令

```
python3 infer_axmodel.py
```

The image depicts a large, historic statue of Liberty, located in New York City. The statue is a prominent landmark in the city and is known for its iconic presence and historical significance. The statue is located on Liberty Island, which is a part of the Empire State Building complex. The statue is made of bronze and is mounted on a pedestal. The pedestal is rectangular and has a weathered look, suggesting it has been in use for a long time. The statue is surrounded by a large, open area, which is likely a plaza or a plaza park.

The statue is surrounded by a large, open space, which is likely a plaza or a plaza park.

## 模型速度  
| Stage | Time |
|------|------|
| Vision Encoder (PTQ U16) | 121 ms  | 
| Prefill |  512ms    |
| Decode  |  11.6 token/s |

实际模型耗时没这么大，python 代码性能不太好，用 [C++ code](./cpp)的话会更快。
